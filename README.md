# AI-Powered Chatbot for Codebase Enhancement

This project contains an AI-powered chatbot designed to automatically enhance and refactor a codebase. The chatbot uses a model runner, Docker, and GitHub Actions to create a fully automated, step-by-step code improvement system.

## Overview

The core of this project is an agent that can:

-   Analyze a codebase to understand its structure and functionality.
-   Read instructional documents (`agent.md`, `instructions.md`, etc.) to guide its actions.
-   Autonomously implement new features, refactor code, and fix bugs.
-   Use Docker to create a consistent and reproducible environment for execution.
-   Be triggered via GitHub Actions to run on a schedule or in response to events.

## Getting Started

For detailed instructions on how to set up and run this project, please see `instructions.md`. To understand the project's layout, refer to `structure.md`.
